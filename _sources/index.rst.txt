Welcome to Sphinx-Open-Needs documentation!
=============================================
**Sphinx-Open-Needs** is a Sphinx extension that combines the power of
`Sphinx-Needs <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/>`_
and `Open-Needs server <https://open-needs.org/open_needs_server/>`_.

In general, Sphinx-Open-Needs is based on Sphinx-Needs, but gets its data from an Open-Needs server.
